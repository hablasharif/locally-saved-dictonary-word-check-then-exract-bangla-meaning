Donald Trump called on Americans Sunday to stand united after he was injured in an assassination attempt â€“ a shocking incident that opened a dark new chapter in an already polarized US presidential race.

The 78-year-old former president was hit in the ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, while the shooter and a bystander were killed and two spectators critically injured in the worst act of US political violence in decades.

"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United," Trump said in a statement on his Truth Social network, adding that Americans should not allow "Evil to win".

The Republican added that it was "God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening" and that he would "FEAR NOT".

The gunman has been identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about an hour's drive from the rally site, according to an FBI statement early Sunday.
